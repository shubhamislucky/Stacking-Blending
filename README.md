# Stacking-Blending
In this project, I participated in the House Prices competition on Kaggle and scored a top 3% on the leaderboard.
I provided an in depth Explanatory Data Analysis of the problem with clear visualizations and used simple Stacking and Blending of different machine learning models to predict the target variable.
I hope you like it.
